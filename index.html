                <p>
                    Hi. I spend my days making things. I can make things on screens. This is not very useful, so I also learned to save the things we make on screens. This is OK, but it's pretty lonely
                    so I also learned how to have my thing eat other things stuck in the spider's web. This is pretty selfish though, so I rounded it off by making sure my thing can be eaten by other things as well.
                    Now I am full, but I want to make bigger things. I am sure you want to help out so drop me a line at richard.theuma@gmail.com.
