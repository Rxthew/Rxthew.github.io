                        <p>
                            I built a rudimentary search engine in Python through a guided setup for an 
                            <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/courses/cs101" target="_blank">introductory computer science course</a>. 
                            This was my introduction to programming. Later on, I <a href="https://github.com/rxthew/Webscraper-scripts">wrote some scripts for web scraping</a> and 
                            <a href="https://github.com/rxthew/seriesclassifierbeta" target="_blank">dabbled with AI</a>. However, my featured body of work is based around web development, 
                            specifially in fulfilment of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank">the Odin Project</a>, which is an open source curriculum developed and maintained 
                            by software developers in the field. Here I gained the ability to independently build projects across the whole stack.

                        <p>
                            I can build accessible, responsive, cross-browser compatible frontends and I can implement database schemas and models and handle
                            routes on the backend. I also have experience with unit testing, APIs, Git and Bash. My experience is based on
                            JavaScript frameworks so: TypeScript, Express and Node.js, React, Mongoose, Sequelize, Passport, and Jest. However, my programming
                            fundamentals are agnostic, I have, for example, been able to translate my Express knowledge to Flask in Python seamlessly.

                        <p>
                            I have participated in two of Bellingcat's hackathons to build tools for open-source researchers. These resulted in a 
                            <a href="https://github.com/0x7dee/graphwork" target="_blank">social network analysis tool</a> and 
                            a <a href="https://github.com/octo-web" target="_blank">front-end interface for a preexisting command-line tool.</a>
                            Both hackathons had a timeframe of three days, which pushed me to develop minimally viable products under time constraints.
                            For the first hackatahon, I had the opportunity to pair program with another participant. We had to divide the work between us, and we had limited windows 
                            to communicate because we were from different timezones. This is the <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/09/19/identifying-suspicious-businesses-reddit-analysis

                            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> has a thriving community on Discord where I participated in mentoring other learners.
                            I reaped great rewards from this practice, because I gained an insight into programming habits different from my own and varied ways of approaching problems.
                            Having to guide learners towards their solution, without imposing your own preferred way is difficult. I found that in explaining something, or at times, 
                            realising I do not know something as throughly as I thought I did ultimately made me a more rounded developer. Not to mention the inherent satisfaction of helping a total
                            stranger get unstuck.

                        <p>
                            One of my immediate priorities is to increase my open-source contributions. So far, I have a single contribution for 
                            <a href="https://www.if-me.org" target="_blank">a mental health community</a>, where I had the straightforward task of 
                            <a href="https://github.com/ifmeorg/ifme/pull/2205" target="_blank">adding images to a text editor.</a>

                            I read for Masters degrees in Law and Criminology and through that I am well-versed in research and documentation. I am also
                            able to use quantitative methods on small datasets using Stata or UCINET, for social graphs. I have also used Tableau to 
                            visualise data in a classroom setting. I have experience as a Compliance Analyst for investment firms which involved writing
                            reports, interviewing clients for monitoring, and advising them on steps to take to comply with the relevant rules.
